# Stern-Gerlach-Experiment-Applet
 A recreation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment which illuminated the spin property of electrons and helped to birth the field of quantum mechanics.

To use the applet, run "python main.py"
Click the "Heat!" button to generate an electron boiled off from the Ag block which has a 50-50% chance of having a positive
spin 1/2 or of having a negative spin -1/2. 
The electron will travel to the right through the slit and upon reaching the magnetic field gradient will then travel
either upwards or downwards depending on the positive or negative spin. The trajectory will also have a Gaussian distribution
bias to introduce randomness and represent real-world conditions.
